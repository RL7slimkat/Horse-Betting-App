# Horse-Betting-App
A native Android Horse betting app/game/simulator inspired by GTA V's Inside Track that allows the user to place bets on a horse and win virtual money. The project was built in roughly 2-3 days and is therefore missing a few key features that I'd like to add in the near future but the app works fine from start to finish.

This is a school project for my first android class, however I treated it like a personal project and worked extremely hard on it. I'm not sure how licenses work but I do not want people using my code for their own personal gain, however I'm okay with people sharing, and modfying the code, just not distributing it as their own for profit. Any derrivatives cannot be distributed for profit.
